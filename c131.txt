name - name of the planet.

light_years_from_earth - Distance
of the exo-planet from earth in light
years.

planet_mass - Mass of the planet.
stellar_magnitude - This is the
brightness of the host star of the
planet when observed from Earth (just
as the sun is our host star).

discovery_date - This is the year of
discovery for the exo-planet.

planet_type - This is the type of the
planet (Gas Giant, Super Earth, etc.).

planet_radius - This is the radius of
the exo-planet with respect to Earth or
Jupiter.

orbital_radius - This is the average
distance of this exo-planet from its
sun. Just like our solar system has 1
sun, there are multiple solar systems
that contain many planets and sun(s).
orbital_period - This is the time it
takes to complete one orbit of it’s sun.

eccentricity - This denotes how
circular the orbit is. It might be oval in
shape too. The lower the eccentricity,
the more circular is the orbit.

solar_system_name - The name of
the host solar system.

planet_discovery_method - This is
the discovery method which was used
to find this exo-planet.

planet_orbital_inclination - This is
the orbital inclination, which means
that it is the tilt of the exo-planet’s
orbit when it revolves around its sun.
planet_density - This is the density
of the planet.

right_ascension - This is the right
ascension of the planetary system,
which is the east-west coordinate by
which the position of this planet is
measured.

declination - This is the north-south
coordinate by which the position of
the planet is measured.

host_temperature - This is the
temperature of the host star in Kelvin.

host_mass - This is the amount of
mass contained in the host star.

host_radius - This is the radius of the
host star.
