We found out the gravity of all the
planets and then based on the fact
that our body can withstand 90 times
more gravity than what Earth offers,
we found out a list of 3,951 planets
that have a gravity of 10 times or
lower than what we have on Earth,
just to be comfortable.


Now that we have the types of planets that are out there, let’s 
understand these terms -

Neptune-like => These planets are like neptune! They are big in 
size and have rings around them. They are also made of Ice.

Super-Earth => These are the planets that have mass greater than 
earth but smaller than that of Neptune! (Neptune is 17 times Earth)

Terrestrial => It is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate 
rocks or metals (Like Earth, Mars)

Gas Giant => There are the planets that are composed of Gas (Hydrogen 
and Helium)

Based on this, let’s try to do some clustering to see if there is any 
relation between planet type and mass of the planet. It looks like 
there is but let’s see.
