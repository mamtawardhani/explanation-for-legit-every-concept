ngrok is a cross-platform application that enables developers to 
expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. 
The software makes your locally-hosted web server appear to be hosted 
on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name 
on the local machine is needed.




What is ngrok? Your development machine may be connected to a secure 
network behind a firewall. To work around access restrictions, ngrok 
runs a small client process on your machine which creates a private 
connection tunnel to the cloud service. Your localhost development 
server is mapped to an ngrok.io sub-domain, which a remote user can 
then access. Thereâ€™s no need to expose ports, set up forwarding, or 
make other network changes.


ngrok is a terminal based software that allows one to run his local host 
web
page on other devices, it provides a link, with which we can be forwarded 
to a special local host.
