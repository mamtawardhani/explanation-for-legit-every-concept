(1) If a year is evenly divisible by 4 means having no remainder 
then go to next step. If it is not divisible by 4. It is not a 
leap year. For example: 1997 is not a leap year.


(2)If a year is divisible by 4, but not by 100. For example: 2012, 
it is a leap year. If a year is divisible by both 4 and 100, go to 
next step.


(3)If a year is divisible by 100, but not by 400. For example: 1900, 
then it is not a leap year. If a year is divisible by both, then it 
is a leap year. So 2000 is a leap year.



# divided by 100 means century year (ending with 00)
# century year divided by 400 is leap year
if (year % 400 == 0) and (year % 100 == 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# not divided by 100 means not a century year
# year divided by 4 is a leap year
elif (year % 4 ==0) and (year % 100 != 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# if not divided by both 400 (century year) and 4 (not century year)
# year is not leap year
else:
    print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
