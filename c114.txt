Regression in machine learning consists of mathematical methods that 
allow data scientists to predict a continuous outcome (y) based on 
the value of one or more predictor variables (x). 
Linear regression is probably the most popular form of regression analysis because of its 
ease-of-use in predicting and forecasting
